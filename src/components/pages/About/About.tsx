              ... a tech enthusiast, lifelong learner, and self-proclaimed
              serial hobbyist working as an Enterprise Architect at Workday. I
              thrive on turning chaos into clarity, solving complex problems,
              and occasionally pushing my body past its limits with (far too
              much) volleyball.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I&lsquo;m not diving into technology, you&lsquo;ll find me on
              the volleyball court, exploring new cuisines as an adventurous
              foodie, or bringing my latest creative ideas to life. This site is
              my space to sharpen my coding skills, share what I&lsquo;m
              learning, and build tools that bring even more structure to my
              world.
            </p>
